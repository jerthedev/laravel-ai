```php
<?php

return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Default AI Provider
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    */
    'default' => env('AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER', 'openai'),

    /*

    */

    ],
];
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes in isolation
2. **Feature Tests**: Test complete workflows
3. **Integration Tests**: Test database interactions

### Mock Provider
Create a mock AI provider for testing that:
- Returns predictable responses
- Simulates different scenarios (success, failure, timeout)
- Tracks method calls for verification

### Test Database
- Use SQLite in-memory database for tests
- Ensure migrations run correctly
- Test data cleanup between tests

## Definition of Done

- [x] All user stories are completed and tested
- [x] Code coverage is above 80% (achieved 81.46%)
- [x] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline (260 tests passing)
- [x] Documentation is updated (README, CHANGELOG created)
- [x] Code review is completed (PHPStan level 6 passing, Pint formatting)
- [x] Package can be installed and basic functionality works

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Laravel Version Compatibility
**Mitigation**: Test with multiple Laravel versions in CI

### Risk 2: Database Migration Issues
**Mitigation**: Test migrations on different database engines

### Risk 3: Configuration Complexity
**Mitigation**: Provide clear examples and validation

## Sprint Review Criteria

1. Package installs successfully via Composer
2. Configuration system works with environment variables
3. Database migrations create all required tables
4. AI facade responds to basic method calls
5. Mock provider works for testing
6. All tests pass with good coverage
7. CI/CD pipeline is functional

## Next Sprint Preview

Sprint 2 will focus on implementing the first AI provider driver (OpenAI) with:
- Complete API integration
- Message sending and receiving
- Model management
- Cost calculation
- Error handling and retries

## Sprint Retrospective

### What went well
- **Comprehensive Foundation**: Successfully established a solid architectural foundation with all core components implemented
- **Test-Driven Development**: Achieved excellent test coverage (81.46%) with 260+ tests across Unit, Feature, and Integration categories
- **CI/CD Excellence**: Implemented robust GitHub Actions pipeline with multi-version testing, static analysis, and code coverage
- **Code Quality**: Maintained high code quality with PHPStan level 6 static analysis and Laravel Pint code formatting
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation including README, CHANGELOG, and project guidelines
- **Laravel Integration**: Perfect integration with Laravel conventions including auto-discovery, service providers, and facades
- **Database Design**: Well-designed database schema with proper relationships, indexes, and migration rollback support
- **Mock Provider**: Comprehensive mock provider enables immediate testing and development without external dependencies

### What could be improved
- **Code Coverage**: While 81.46% is good, some classes like TokenUsage (46.67% methods) and AIResponse (58.33% methods) could benefit from more comprehensive testing
- **Configuration Complexity**: The configuration system, while functional, could be simplified for easier developer onboarding
- **Documentation Depth**: While comprehensive, some advanced usage patterns and extension examples could be added
- **Error Handling**: Some exception classes have lower coverage and could benefit from more thorough testing

### What we learned
- **Architecture First**: Starting with solid interfaces and contracts made implementation much smoother
- **Testing Strategy**: Having a comprehensive mock provider from the beginning enabled rapid development and testing
- **Laravel Conventions**: Following Laravel patterns closely made integration seamless and familiar to developers
- **CI/CD Value**: Early implementation of CI/CD caught issues quickly and maintained code quality throughout development
- **Documentation Importance**: Comprehensive documentation from the start helps maintain consistency and clarity

### What we will do differently next time
- **Earlier Performance Testing**: Include performance benchmarks and memory usage tests from the beginning
- **More Granular Tasks**: Some tasks were larger than ideal; breaking them down further would improve tracking
- **Integration Testing**: More real-world integration scenarios could be tested even with mock providers
- **Security Review**: Earlier security review of credential handling and data encryption

### Additional Notes
- The package foundation is extremely solid and ready for real provider implementations
- The driver architecture is flexible and will easily accommodate different AI provider APIs
- The testing framework provides excellent confidence for future development
- All Sprint 1 objectives were met or exceeded
- The package follows Laravel best practices and conventions throughout
- Ready to proceed with Sprint 2: Real Provider Implementation

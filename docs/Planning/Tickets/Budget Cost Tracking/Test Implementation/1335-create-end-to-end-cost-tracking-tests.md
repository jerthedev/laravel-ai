# Create End-to-End Cost Tracking Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test Implementation/1035-create-end-to-end-cost-tracking-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Create End-to-End Cost Tracking Tests with Real AI Provider Integration

## Description
End-to-end tests are needed to verify that the complete cost tracking and budget management system works correctly with real AI providers. These tests will validate the entire flow from AI requests through cost calculation, budget enforcement, and alert generation.

**Current State:**
- Existing E2E tests focus on individual components
- No comprehensive end-to-end cost tracking validation
- Real AI provider integration not systematically tested
- Budget enforcement flow not tested end-to-end
- Alert generation and delivery not tested in complete flow

**Desired State:**
- Complete end-to-end test suite for cost tracking workflows
- Real AI provider integration testing with actual API calls
- Budget enforcement testing with real cost calculations
- Alert generation and delivery testing
- Performance validation under realistic load

**E2E Test Scenarios:**
1. **Complete Cost Tracking Flow** - AI request → cost calculation → database storage
2. **Budget Enforcement Flow** - Cost tracking → budget checking → enforcement
3. **Alert Generation Flow** - Budget threshold → alert generation → delivery
4. **Multi-Provider Flow** - Multiple AI providers → cost aggregation → analytics
5. **Hierarchical Budget Flow** - User → project → organization budget enforcement

- [ ] Alert generation and delivery tested end-to-end
- [ ] Multi-provider cost aggregation tested
- [ ] Hierarchical budget enforcement tested
- [ ] Performance validated under realistic load scenarios
- [ ] All E2E tests use real provider credentials when available
- [ ] Tests gracefully skip when credentials are not available
- [ ] E2E tests validate data consistency across all components
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases tested in complete flows

## Notes
- Use real AI provider credentials from tests/credentials/e2e-credentials.json
- Tests should be designed to minimize API costs while providing comprehensive coverage
- Include performance benchmarks and load testing scenarios
- Ensure tests can run in CI/CD pipeline with appropriate credential management

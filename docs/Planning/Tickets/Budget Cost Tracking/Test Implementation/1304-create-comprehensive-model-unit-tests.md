# Create Comprehensive Model Unit Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test Implementation/1033-create-comprehensive-model-unit-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Create Comprehensive Unit Tests for All Cost Tracking and Budget Management Models

## Description
With the creation of missing Eloquent models, comprehensive unit tests are needed to ensure model functionality, relationships, validation, and business logic work correctly. The current test suite lacks proper model-level testing for the core cost tracking and budget management functionality.

**Current State:**
- Missing unit tests for newly created models (Budget, CostRecord, BudgetAlert, etc.)
- Existing models (AIProviderModelCost, TokenUsage) have limited test coverage
- No systematic testing of model relationships and business logic
- Model validation and accessor/mutator methods untested

**Desired State:**
- Complete unit test coverage for all cost tracking and budget models
- Comprehensive testing of model relationships (belongsTo, hasMany, etc.)
- Validation rule testing and business logic verification
- Accessor/mutator method testing
- Model factory integration testing

**Models Requiring Unit Tests:**
1. **Budget** - Budget management and utilization calculations
2. **CostRecord** - Cost tracking and analytics methods
3. **BudgetAlert** - Alert generation and severity logic
4. **BudgetAlertConfig** - Configuration validation and defaults
5. **CostAnalytics** - Analytics aggregation and calculations
6. **Enhanced AIProviderModelCost** - Pricing calculations and queries
7. **Enhanced TokenUsage** - Cost calculation validation

## Notes
- Use existing AIProviderModelCost and TokenUsage tests as quality examples
- Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
- Ensure model factories generate realistic test data
- Consider testing model events and observers if implemented

## Estimated Effort
XL (2+ days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 1012-create-missing-eloquent-models - Models must exist before testing
- [ ] Model factories must be created for efficient test data generation

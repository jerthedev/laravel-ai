## Title
Test Ollama Driver Implementation

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY COMPLETENESS TESTING**: This ticket validates the implementation of the missing Ollama driver (ticket 1020). The audit revealed that Ollama was configured and documented as supported but completely missing from implementation. This testing ensures the new Ollama driver works correctly with local models and zero-cost pricing.

**Testing Scope**:
- OllamaDriver follows trait-based architecture like other providers
- Local model communication works with Ollama server
- Zero-cost pricing integration works correctly
- Response-level cost calculation returns 0 for local models
- Event-based cost aggregation works with zero costs
- Integration with AI Facade and all API patterns

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- Complete 4/4 provider implementation (OpenAI, XAI, Gemini, Ollama)
- Local model support works correctly
- Zero-cost pricing handled properly throughout system
- All API patterns work with Ollama provider

## Related Tests
- [ ] Provider selection tests should include Ollama
- [ ] AI Facade tests should work with Ollama provider
- [ ] Cost calculation tests should handle zero-cost scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OllamaDriver unit tests achieve 100% code coverage
- [ ] All trait implementations follow established patterns
- [ ] Local server communication works correctly (when Ollama server available)
- [ ] Zero-cost pricing returns 0 for all cost calculations
- [ ] Response-level cost calculation works correctly with zero costs
- [ ] Event-based cost aggregation handles zero costs properly
- [ ] Integration with AI Facade works (AI::provider('ollama')->sendMessage())
- [ ] All API patterns work with Ollama provider
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for local server communication
- [ ] Health validation checks Ollama server availability correctly
- [ ] Model management supports Ollama model listing and selection

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/1040-test-ollama-driver-implementation.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This tests the implementation of the missing Ollama driver that completes 4/4 provider support. Ollama is unique because it supports local models with zero-cost pricing.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Validate trait-based architecture follows established patterns
2. Test local server communication (when Ollama available)
3. Verify zero-cost pricing integration throughout system
4. Test integration with AI Facade and all API patterns
5. Validate error handling for local server scenarios

OLLAMA SPECIFICS:
- Local server communication (typically http://localhost:11434)
- Zero-cost pricing for local models
- Different API format from cloud providers
- May have different capabilities than cloud providers

Based on this ticket:
1. Create comprehensive test plan for Ollama driver implementation
2. Design unit tests for all traits following established patterns
3. Plan integration tests for local server communication
4. Design zero-cost pricing validation tests
5. Plan E2E tests with conditional Ollama server availability
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider local server dependencies, zero-cost pricing, and provider pattern consistency.
```

## Notes
- Completes the 4/4 provider implementation testing
- Zero-cost pricing requires special testing considerations
- Local server dependency may require conditional testing
- Should follow established provider testing patterns

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1020: Ollama driver implementation must be completed
- [ ] Ollama server for local testing (may be optional/conditional)
- [ ] Understanding of zero-cost pricing integration
- [ ] Driver testing patterns from other providers

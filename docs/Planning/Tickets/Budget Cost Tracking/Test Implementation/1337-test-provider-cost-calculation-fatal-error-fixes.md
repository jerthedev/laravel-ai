## Title
Test Provider Cost Calculation Fatal Error Fixes

## Description
**HIGH PRIORITY TESTING**: This ticket validates the fixes for provider cost calculation fatal errors (ticket 1017). The audit revealed that OpenAI and Gemini drivers had fatal errors due to static method calls, and XAI had field name mismatches. These fixes are critical for proper event-based cost aggregation.

**Testing Scope**:
- OpenAI driver cost calculation works without fatal errors
- Gemini driver can execute API calls without crashing
- XAI driver calculates costs accurately with correct field names
- All provider CalculatesCosts traits use instance methods correctly
- CostCalculated events contain accurate cost data for all providers

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- No fatal errors in any provider cost calculation
- All providers can execute real API calls successfully
- CostCalculated events show accurate non-zero cost data
- Event-based cost aggregation works correctly for all providers

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/1037-test-provider-cost-calculation-fatal-error-fixes.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This tests the fixes for provider cost calculation fatal errors:
- OpenAI: Fixed static method calls to ModelPricing::estimateCost() and ModelPricing::getModelPricing()
- Gemini: Fixed same static method call errors that prevented execution
- XAI: Fixed field name mismatches ($pricing['input_per_1m'] vs $pricing['input'])

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Validate all providers use instance methods correctly (no static calls)
2. Verify no fatal errors during cost calculation
3. Test CostCalculated events contain accurate cost data
4. Validate event-based cost aggregation works for all providers
5. Ensure real API calls execute successfully

PROVIDER-SPECIFIC TESTING:
- OpenAI: Test instance method usage and accurate cost calculation
- Gemini: Test execution without fatal errors and cost calculation
- XAI: Test correct field name usage and accurate cost calculation

Based on this ticket:
1. Create comprehensive test plan for provider cost calculation fixes
2. Design unit tests for each provider's CalculatesCosts trait
3. Plan E2E tests that validate real API cost calculation
4. Design event-based cost aggregation validation tests
5. Plan error handling and edge case testing
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider provider-specific differences and error scenarios.
```

## Notes
- Critical for event-based cost aggregation functionality
- Must test that OpenAI and Gemini no longer have fatal errors
- Should validate XAI field name corrections
- Important for CostCalculated event accuracy

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1017: Provider cost calculation fatal error fixes must be implemented
- [ ] Real API credentials for testing all providers
- [ ] Understanding of correct instance method patterns vs static method errors
- [ ] Event system functionality for testing cost aggregation

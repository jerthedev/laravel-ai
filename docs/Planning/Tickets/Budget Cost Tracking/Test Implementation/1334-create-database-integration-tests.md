# Create Database Integration Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test Implementation/1034-create-database-integration-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Create Comprehensive Database Integration Tests for Cost Tracking and Budget Management

## Description
Database integration tests are needed to verify that the database schema, foreign key constraints, indexes, and complex queries work correctly together. These tests will validate the database layer functionality that unit tests cannot cover.

**Current State:**
- Limited database integration testing
- No systematic testing of foreign key constraints
- Query performance and index usage not validated
- Complex multi-table operations not tested
- Migration rollback scenarios not tested

**Desired State:**
- Comprehensive database integration test suite
- Foreign key constraint enforcement testing
- Index usage and query performance validation
- Complex multi-table operation testing
- Migration and rollback testing

**Integration Test Categories:**
1. **Foreign Key Constraint Tests** - Verify referential integrity
2. **Index Usage Tests** - Verify queries use proper indexes
3. **Complex Query Tests** - Test multi-table joins and aggregations
4. **Migration Tests** - Test migration execution and rollback
5. **Data Integrity Tests** - Test cascade deletes and updates
6. **Performance Tests** - Validate query performance benchmarks

## Notes
- Use database transactions for test isolation
- Consider using separate test database for integration tests
- Include performance benchmarks in integration tests
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 1010-add-missing-foreign-key-constraints - Foreign keys must exist for constraint testing
- [ ] 1011-create-missing-database-tables - All tables must exist for integration testing
- [ ] 1014-optimize-database-query-performance - Query optimizations should be complete

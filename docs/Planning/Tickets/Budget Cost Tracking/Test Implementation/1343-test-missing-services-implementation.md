# Test Implementation Ticket 1043

**Ticket ID**: Test Implementation/1043-test-missing-services-implementation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Test Missing Services Implementation

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY COMPLETENESS TESTING**: This ticket validates the implementation of missing services referenced in specifications (ticket 1023). The audit revealed that TokenUsageExtractor and CostCalculationService were referenced in specifications but not implemented. This testing ensures the new services work correctly and integrate with existing services.

**Testing Scope**:
- TokenUsageExtractor provides centralized token extraction logic
- CostCalculationService provides centralized cost calculation utilities
- Services integrate with existing services (BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, PricingService)
- Services follow established patterns and dependency injection
- Services are used by appropriate components (providers, middleware, etc.)

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- Complete service architecture matching specifications
- Services provide centralized utilities as intended
- Integration with existing services works correctly
- Performance is acceptable for service operations

You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/1043-test-missing-services-implementation.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

COMPLETENESS ISSUE RESOLVED: Services referenced in specifications but not implemented:
1. TokenUsageExtractor - Centralized token extraction logic
2. CostCalculationService - Centralized cost calculation utilities

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Validate TokenUsageExtractor centralized token extraction functionality
2. Test CostCalculationService centralized cost calculation utilities
3. Verify integration with existing services
4. Test dependency injection registration
5. Validate service usage by appropriate components

EXISTING SERVICES FOR INTEGRATION:
- BudgetService
- CostAnalyticsService
- PricingService

Based on this ticket:
1. Create comprehensive test plan for missing services implementation
2. Design unit tests for TokenUsageExtractor with full coverage
3. Plan unit tests for CostCalculationService with full coverage
4. Design integration tests for service interactions
5. Plan dependency injection and service architecture tests
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider service architecture, dependency injection, and integration with existing services.
```

## Notes
- Completes the service architecture referenced in specifications
- Should test integration with existing services
- Important for architectural completeness and consistency
- Lower priority than core cost tracking fixes but important for specifications alignment

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1023: Missing services implementation must be completed
- [ ] Existing services (BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, PricingService) for integration
- [ ] LaravelAIServiceProvider for dependency injection testing
- [ ] Understanding of service architecture patterns

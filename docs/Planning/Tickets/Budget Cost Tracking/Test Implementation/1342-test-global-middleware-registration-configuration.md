# Test Implementation Ticket 1042

**Ticket ID**: Test Implementation/1042-test-global-middleware-registration-configuration  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Test Global Middleware Registration and Configuration

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY CONFIGURATION TESTING**: This ticket validates the global middleware registration and configuration fixes (ticket 1022). The audit revealed that while middleware was configured and enabled by default, no global middleware was actually registered, so middleware features didn't work out of the box. This testing ensures middleware works immediately after package installation.

**Testing Scope**:
- CostTrackingMiddleware and BudgetEnforcementMiddleware registered globally by default
- Configuration allows disabling global middleware
- Configuration allows customizing middleware order and settings
- Middleware works immediately after package installation
- Per-request middleware customization works correctly

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- Out-of-box functionality: middleware works immediately after installation
- Configuration flexibility: users can disable or customize middleware
- Performance: acceptable performance impact for default configuration
- Backward compatibility: existing configurations continue to work

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BudgetEnforcementMiddleware registered globally by default (when enabled in config)
- [ ] Configuration allows disabling global middleware completely
- [ ] Configuration allows customizing middleware order and settings
- [ ] LaravelAIServiceProvider registers middleware based on configuration correctly
- [ ] Middleware works immediately after package installation with default config
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable for default configuration (< 20ms overhead)
- [ ] Clear documentation on middleware configuration options is validated
- [ ] Users can override global middleware with per-request settings
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing configurations

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/1042-test-global-middleware-registration-configuration.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CONFIGURATION ISSUE RESOLVED: Middleware was configured and enabled by default but no global middleware was registered, so middleware features didn't work out of the box.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Validate global middleware registration by default
2. Test configuration options for enabling/disabling middleware
3. Verify out-of-box functionality after package installation
4. Test per-request middleware customization
5. Validate performance impact of default configuration

MIDDLEWARE REGISTRATION:
- CostTrackingMiddleware registered globally by default
- BudgetEnforcementMiddleware registered globally by default
- Configuration controls enable/disable and customization
- Per-request overrides work correctly

Based on this ticket:
1. Create comprehensive test plan for global middleware registration
2. Design tests for LaravelAIServiceProvider middleware registration
3. Plan configuration testing for all middleware options
4. Design out-of-box functionality tests
5. Plan performance tests for default configuration
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider package installation, configuration flexibility, and performance impact.
```

## Notes
- Important for out-of-box user experience after package installation
- Should test that middleware works immediately with default configuration
- Must validate configuration flexibility for customization
- Performance testing important for default configuration impact

## Estimated Effort
Small (< 4 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1022: Global middleware registration and configuration must be implemented
- [ ] CostTrackingMiddleware implementation (ticket 1018)
- [ ] BudgetEnforcementMiddleware (existing)
- [ ] LaravelAIServiceProvider middleware registration logic

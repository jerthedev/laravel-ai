# Implement Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1015-implement-cache-invalidation-strategy  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Implement Systematic Cache Invalidation Strategy for Cost Tracking and Budget Data

## Description
The caching analysis revealed that while caching is well-implemented for performance, there is no systematic cache invalidation strategy. This leads to stale data being served when budgets change, costs are recorded, or configurations are updated, which can cause incorrect budget enforcement and outdated analytics.

**Current State:**
- Excellent caching implementation with appropriate TTL values
- No cache invalidation when underlying data changes
- Stale budget data can cause incorrect budget enforcement
- Outdated cost analytics served from cache
- Manual cache clearing required for data consistency

**Desired State:**
- Event-driven cache invalidation when data changes
- Consistent cache invalidation patterns across all services
- Cache tags for efficient bulk invalidation
- Automatic cache warming for frequently accessed data
- Configurable cache invalidation strategies

**Cache Invalidation Scenarios:**
1. **Budget Changes**: When budgets are created, updated, or deleted
2. **Cost Recording**: When new cost records are added
3. **Alert Configuration**: When alert settings are modified
4. **User Changes**: When users are deleted or modified
5. **Model Updates**: When pricing or model data changes

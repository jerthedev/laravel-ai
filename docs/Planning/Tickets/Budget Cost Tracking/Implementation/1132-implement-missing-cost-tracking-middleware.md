# Implementation Ticket 1018

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1018-implement-missing-cost-tracking-middleware  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Implement Missing CostTrackingMiddleware for AI Request Pipeline

## Description
**HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE**: The audit revealed that CostTrackingMiddleware is referenced throughout the codebase (tests, documentation, configuration) but the actual implementation is missing. This prevents middleware-based cost tracking and budget enforcement from functioning.

**Current State**:
- CostTrackingMiddleware referenced in tests and documentation but doesn't exist
- BudgetEnforcementMiddleware exists but CostTrackingMiddleware is missing
- Middleware system exists but lacks the core cost tracking component
- Configuration references CostTrackingMiddleware but it's not implemented
- No middleware-based cost tracking available

**Desired State**:
- CostTrackingMiddleware implemented and integrated into AI request pipeline
- Middleware-based cost tracking works alongside event-based aggregation
- Budget enforcement can rely on middleware cost tracking
- Consistent middleware architecture across all AI request patterns
- Cost tracking middleware can be enabled/disabled via configuration

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Implement CostTrackingMiddleware following AIMiddlewareInterface
- Integrate with response-level cost calculation (from ticket 1016)
- Support both pre-request budget checks and post-request cost recording
- Work with existing BudgetEnforcementMiddleware
- Follow existing middleware patterns and configuration structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CostTrackingMiddleware class implements AIMiddlewareInterface correctly
- [ ] Middleware integrates with response-level cost calculation system
- [ ] Pre-request budget validation prevents expensive requests when budget exceeded
- [ ] Post-request cost recording updates user spending totals
- [ ] Middleware can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- [ ] Works with existing BudgetEnforcementMiddleware without conflicts
- [ ] Supports both ConversationBuilder and Direct SendMessage patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 10ms overhead per request)
- [ ] Error handling gracefully handles cost calculation failures
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and E2E tests

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1018-implement-missing-cost-tracking-middleware.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: The audit revealed that CostTrackingMiddleware is referenced everywhere but never implemented. The middleware system exists and BudgetEnforcementMiddleware works, but the core cost tracking middleware is missing.

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Implement AIMiddlewareInterface
2. Integrate with response-level cost calculation (ticket 1016)
3. Work alongside existing BudgetEnforcementMiddleware
4. Support both pre-request and post-request cost processing
5. Follow existing middleware patterns and configuration

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for implementing CostTrackingMiddleware
2. Design the middleware architecture and integration points
3. Plan the relationship with BudgetEnforcementMiddleware
4. Design comprehensive testing strategy
5. Plan configuration and registration requirements
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider performance, error handling, and integration with existing systems.
```

## Notes
- Referenced throughout codebase but never implemented
- Must work with existing BudgetEnforcementMiddleware
- Should integrate with response-level cost calculation from ticket 1016
- Part of the broader middleware integration issues identified in audit
- Critical for middleware-based budget enforcement

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1016: Response-level cost calculation must be implemented first
- [ ] Existing middleware system and MiddlewareManager
- [ ] BudgetEnforcementMiddleware as reference implementation
- [ ] AIMiddlewareInterface contract

# Fix BudgetEnforcementMiddleware Missing Methods and Event Issues

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1010-fix-budget-enforcement-middleware  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Fix BudgetEnforcementMiddleware Missing Methods and Event Constructor Mismatches

## Description
Fix the critical issues in BudgetEnforcementMiddleware including missing methods that cause fatal errors and event constructor mismatches that prevent proper event firing.

**Current State**: 
- Missing `checkProjectBudgetOptimized()` method (line 155) causing fatal errors
- Missing `checkOrganizationBudgetOptimized()` method (line 160) causing fatal errors
- BudgetThresholdReached event constructor mismatch preventing event dispatch
- Uses AIMessage instead of AIRequest (will be fixed by dependency ticket)

**Desired State**:
- All missing methods implemented with proper budget checking logic
- Event constructor matches actual event class signature
- Middleware works without fatal errors
- Proper budget enforcement for project and organization levels
- Updated to use AIRequest pattern from specification

**Critical Issues Addressed**:
- Fixes fatal errors preventing middleware execution
- Enables proper budget threshold event firing
- Implements missing project and organization budget checks
- Provides complete budget enforcement functionality

**Dependencies**:
- Requires ticket 1109 (AIRequest class) to be completed first
- Requires BudgetThresholdReached event constructor to be verified/fixed

## Implementation Details

### Missing Methods to Implement
```php
/**
 * Check project budget with optimized query
 */
protected function checkProjectBudgetOptimized(int $projectId, float $additionalCost): array
{
    // Implementation needed:
    // 1. Query project budget limits from database
    // 2. Calculate current usage for the project
    // 3. Check if additionalCost would exceed limits
    // 4. Return budget status and threshold information
    
    return [
        'exceeded' => false,
        'current_usage' => 0.0,
        'limit' => 100.0,
        'threshold_percentage' => 0.0,
        'would_exceed' => false,
    ];
}

/**
 * Check organization budget with optimized query
 */
protected function checkOrganizationBudgetOptimized(int $organizationId, float $additionalCost): array
{
    // Implementation needed:
    // 1. Query organization budget limits from database
    // 2. Calculate current usage for the organization
    // 3. Check if additionalCost would exceed limits
    // 4. Return budget status and threshold information
    
    return [
        'exceeded' => false,
        'current_usage' => 0.0,
        'limit' => 1000.0,
        'threshold_percentage' => 0.0,
        'would_exceed' => false,
    ];
}
```

### Event Constructor Fix
Current (broken):
```php
event(new BudgetThresholdReached(
    $additionalCost,
    $thresholdPercentage,
    $projectId,
    $organizationId
));
```

Fixed (matching event constructor):
```php
event(new BudgetThresholdReached(
    percentage: $thresholdPercentage,
    severity: $this->getSeverityLevel($thresholdPercentage),
    userId: $request->getUserId(),
    provider: $request->getProvider(),
    model: $request->getModel(),
    metadata: [
        'additional_cost' => $additionalCost,
        'project_id' => $projectId,
        'organization_id' => $organizationId,
    ]
));
```

### Budget Checking Logic
1. **User Level**: Check individual user daily/monthly limits
2. **Project Level**: Check project budget limits and current usage
3. **Organization Level**: Check organization-wide budget limits
4. **Threshold Warnings**: Fire events at 80% and 95% usage
5. **Exception Handling**: Throw BudgetExceededException when limits exceeded

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1010-fix-budget-enforcement-middleware.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

This ticket fixes critical issues in BudgetEnforcementMiddleware that are causing fatal errors and preventing proper budget enforcement functionality.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for fixing the missing methods and event issues
2. Plan the implementation of checkProjectBudgetOptimized() and checkOrganizationBudgetOptimized() methods
3. Design the budget checking logic for user, project, and organization levels
4. Plan the event constructor fix to match the actual event class signature
5. Design error handling and exception throwing for budget violations
6. Plan comprehensive testing including edge cases and error conditions
7. Ensure performance meets requirements for budget checking operations

Focus on creating reliable budget enforcement that prevents cost overruns while maintaining system performance.
```

## Notes
This ticket addresses critical fatal errors that prevent the middleware from functioning. The missing methods must be implemented with proper database queries and budget calculation logic. The event constructor mismatch must be fixed to enable proper threshold notifications.

## Estimated Effort
Medium (1 day)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1109 - AIRequest class must be completed first
- [ ] BudgetThresholdReached event constructor signature must be verified
- [ ] BudgetService must be available for budget calculations

# Register Missing Event Listeners for Budget System

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1009-register-missing-event-listeners  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Register Missing Event Listeners in LaravelAIServiceProvider

## Description
Several event listeners exist but are not properly registered in the service provider, preventing them from processing events. Most critically, the BudgetAlertListener exists but is not registered to handle BudgetThresholdReached events, and other valuable events like CostAnomalyDetected and CostTrackingFailed have no listeners registered.

**Current State**: Event listeners exist in the codebase but are not registered in LaravelAIServiceProvider, so they never receive events to process.

**Desired State**: All event listeners are properly registered with their corresponding events and can process events according to configuration settings.

**Root Cause**: Service provider registration was incomplete - listeners were created but the registration step was missed or incomplete.

**Impact**: 
- BudgetAlertListener never processes budget threshold events
- Cost anomaly detection events are not processed
- Cost tracking failure events are not handled
- Reduced system monitoring and alerting capabilities

**Dependencies**: This ticket should be completed after tickets 1107 and 1108 to ensure the events and listeners are compatible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BudgetAlertListener is registered for BudgetThresholdReached events:
  - [ ] Added to registerEventListeners() method in LaravelAIServiceProvider
  - [ ] Configurable via ai.events.listeners.budget_alerts.enabled setting
  - [ ] Properly handles both queued and synchronous processing
- [ ] CostAnomalyDetected event has appropriate listeners registered:
  - [ ] Consider creating CostAnomalyListener or using existing AnalyticsListener
  - [ ] Configurable via ai.events.listeners.cost_anomaly.enabled setting
- [ ] CostTrackingFailed event has appropriate listeners registered:
  - [ ] Consider creating ErrorTrackingListener or using existing NotificationListener
  - [ ] Configurable via ai.events.listeners.error_tracking.enabled setting
- [ ] All listener registrations follow existing patterns:
  - [ ] Use Event::listen() with proper class references
  - [ ] Include configuration checks for enabling/disabling
  - [ ] Support method-specific handlers where appropriate (e.g., @handleMethod)
- [ ] Configuration structure is consistent:
  - [ ] Add new listener configurations to config/ai.php
  - [ ] Follow existing naming conventions
  - [ ] Include proper defaults (enabled: true for critical listeners)
- [ ] Service provider registration is efficient:
  - [ ] Listeners only registered when enabled
  - [ ] No duplicate registrations
  - [ ] Proper error handling for missing listener classes
- [ ] All registered listeners can be resolved from container
- [ ] Event dispatching triggers registered listeners correctly
- [ ] Configuration changes properly enable/disable listeners
- [ ] All unit tests pass with new registrations
- [ ] All integration tests pass with functional event processing

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in service providers and event registration. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1009-register-missing-event-listeners.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- Template: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Major Features: Budget Cost Tracking, Unified Tool System
- Phases: Audit, Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup
- Format: docs/Planning/Tickets/<Major Feature>/<Phase>/####-short-description.md
- Numbering: 1000s for Budget Cost Tracking, 2000s for Unified Tool System

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list breaking down all work needed to complete this ticket
2. Analyze the current service provider registration patterns
3. Plan the configuration structure for new listener registrations
4. Design the registration logic following Laravel best practices
5. Consider performance implications of additional listener registrations
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Focus on:
- Following existing registration patterns in LaravelAIServiceProvider
- Creating proper configuration structure for new listeners
- Ensuring listeners can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Planning for both existing and potentially new listener classes
- Maintaining consistency with current event system architecture

This ticket completes the critical event system foundation by ensuring all listeners are properly registered.
```

## Notes
This ticket focuses on the service provider registration aspect and should be completed after the event and listener compatibility issues are resolved in tickets 1107 and 1108.

**Registration Strategy**:
1. Follow existing patterns in LaravelAIServiceProvider::registerEventListeners()
2. Add configuration options for new listeners
3. Consider creating new listener classes if needed
4. Ensure proper error handling for missing classes

**Configuration Strategy**:
- Add budget_alerts section to ai.events.listeners config
- Add cost_anomaly section for anomaly detection
- Add error_tracking section for failure handling
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing config

## Estimated Effort
Small (2-3 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1107 - Fix BudgetThresholdReached Constructor (should be completed first)
- [ ] Ticket 1108 - Fix BudgetAlertListener Compatibility (should be completed first)

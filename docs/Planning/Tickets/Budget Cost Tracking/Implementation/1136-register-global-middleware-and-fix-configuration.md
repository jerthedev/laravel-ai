# Implementation Ticket 1022

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1022-register-global-middleware-and-fix-configuration  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Register Global Middleware and Fix Configuration for Default Functionality

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY CONFIGURATION ISSUE**: The audit revealed that while the middleware system is configured and enabled by default (`AI_MIDDLEWARE_ENABLED=true`), no global middleware is actually registered. The MiddlewareManager has an empty `$globalMiddleware` array, meaning middleware features don't work out of the box despite being configured.

**Current State**:
- Middleware system configured and enabled by default
- `config('ai.middleware.enabled')` returns true
- MiddlewareManager `$globalMiddleware` array is empty
- No middleware registered in LaravelAIServiceProvider boot method
- Users expect middleware to work by default but it doesn't

**Desired State**:
- Essential middleware registered globally by default
- CostTrackingMiddleware and BudgetEnforcementMiddleware available out of the box
- Configuration allows users to disable or customize middleware
- Clear documentation on middleware configuration options
- Middleware works immediately after package installation

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Register essential middleware in LaravelAIServiceProvider
- Respect configuration settings for enabling/disabling middleware
- Allow per-request middleware customization
- Maintain performance with sensible defaults
- Provide clear configuration documentation

- [ ] BudgetEnforcementMiddleware registered globally by default (when enabled)
- [ ] Configuration allows disabling global middleware
- [ ] Configuration allows customizing middleware order and settings
- [ ] LaravelAIServiceProvider registers middleware based on configuration
- [ ] Middleware works immediately after package installation
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable for default configuration
- [ ] Clear documentation on middleware configuration options
- [ ] Users can override global middleware with per-request settings
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing configurations

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1022-register-global-middleware-and-fix-configuration.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CONFIGURATION ISSUE: Middleware is configured and enabled by default but no global middleware is registered, so middleware features don't work out of the box.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Register essential middleware globally by default
2. Respect configuration for enabling/disabling middleware
3. Allow per-request middleware customization
4. Maintain good performance with sensible defaults
5. Provide clear configuration documentation

MIDDLEWARE TO REGISTER:
- CostTrackingMiddleware (from ticket 1018)
- BudgetEnforcementMiddleware (existing)

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for registering global middleware
2. Design the configuration structure for global middleware
3. Plan the service provider registration logic
4. Design per-request middleware override capabilities
5. Plan documentation and testing strategy
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider performance, configuration flexibility, and user experience.
```

## Notes
- Middleware system exists but no global middleware registered by default
- Should register CostTrackingMiddleware and BudgetEnforcementMiddleware globally
- Must respect configuration settings for enabling/disabling
- Critical for out-of-box functionality after package installation
- Should allow per-request middleware customization

## Estimated Effort
Small (< 4 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1018: CostTrackingMiddleware must be implemented first
- [ ] Existing BudgetEnforcementMiddleware
- [ ] MiddlewareManager global middleware registration system
- [ ] Configuration structure in config/ai.php

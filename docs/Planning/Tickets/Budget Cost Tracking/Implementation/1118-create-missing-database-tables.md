# Create Missing Database Tables

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1011-create-missing-database-tables  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Create Missing Database Tables for Project and Organization Budget Hierarchy

## Description
The database schema audit identified missing tables required for hierarchical budget management. The current implementation only supports user-level budgets, but the specification and business requirements call for project-level and organization-level budget management.

**Current State:**
- Only user-level budgets are supported via `ai_budgets` table
- Project and organization budget references exist in alert tables but no budget tables
- Budget hierarchy functionality is incomplete
- Services reference non-existent project and organization budget tables

**Desired State:**
- `ai_project_budgets` table for project-level budget management
- `ai_organization_budgets` table for organization-level budget management
- Proper hierarchical budget structure supporting user → project → organization levels
- Complete budget hierarchy functionality as specified in requirements

**Why This Work Is Necessary:**
- **Business Requirements**: Multi-level budget management is a core specification requirement
- **Service Dependencies**: Existing services reference these missing tables
- **Scalability**: Enterprise customers need organization and project-level budget controls
- **Compliance**: Required for proper cost allocation and budget enforcement

**Missing Tables Identified:**
1. `ai_project_budgets` - Project-level budget configurations and limits
2. `ai_organization_budgets` - Organization-level budget configurations and limits

- [ ] `ai_organization_budgets` table created with proper schema and indexes
- [ ] Both tables have foreign key constraints to appropriate parent tables
- [ ] Existing `ai_budgets` table updated with `project_id` column for hierarchy

## Notes
- Table schemas should follow the pattern established by existing budget tables
- Consider volume-based pricing and tiered budget structures
- Ensure proper cascade delete behavior for hierarchical relationships
- May require updates to existing services that reference these tables

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 1010-add-missing-foreign-key-constraints - Foreign key patterns established
- [ ] Verification of project and organization table structures if they exist
- [ ] Understanding of hierarchical budget business logic requirements

# Add Missing Foreign Key Constraints

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1010-add-missing-foreign-key-constraints  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27

## Title
Add Missing Foreign Key Constraints for Data Integrity in Cost Tracking and Budget Management Tables

## Description
The database schema audit revealed critical missing foreign key constraints in core cost tracking and budget management tables. This creates significant data integrity risks including orphaned records, inconsistent data, and potential query optimization issues.

**Current State:**
- `ai_usage_costs` table has no foreign key constraints to users, conversations, or messages
- `ai_budgets` table has no foreign key constraint to users
- `ai_budget_alerts` table has no foreign key constraints to users, projects, or organizations
- `ai_budget_alert_configs` table has no foreign key constraints to users, projects, or organizations
- Several tables have commented-out foreign key constraints due to uncertainty

**Desired State:**
- All cost tracking and budget tables have proper foreign key constraints
- Referential integrity is enforced at the database level
- Cascade delete behavior is properly defined
- Data consistency is guaranteed across all related tables

**Why This Work Is Necessary:**
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents orphaned records when users/projects are deleted
- **Query Optimization**: Foreign keys enable better query execution plans
- **Application Safety**: Database-level constraints prevent data corruption
- **Production Readiness**: Essential for production deployment

**Dependencies:**
- Requires verification that referenced tables (users, ai_conversations, ai_messages) exist
- May require data cleanup if orphaned records already exist
- Must coordinate with any existing data migration processes

## Notes
- This is a critical data integrity issue that must be resolved before production deployment
- May require data cleanup migration if orphaned records exist
- Consider using database transactions for safe migration execution
- Foreign key constraints will improve query performance through better execution plans

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Verification that users, ai_conversations, ai_messages tables exist and are properly structured
- [ ] Data cleanup if orphaned records exist in current database
- [ ] Coordination with any ongoing data migration processes

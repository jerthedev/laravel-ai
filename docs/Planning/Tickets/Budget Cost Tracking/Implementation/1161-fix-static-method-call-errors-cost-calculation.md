## Title
Fix Static Method Call Errors Preventing Cost Calculation

## Description
**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION ERROR**: Cost calculation is completely broken due to static method call errors. The audit identified that `ModelPricing::getModelPricing()` is being called statically but is an instance method, causing fatal errors that prevent any cost calculation from working.

### Current State
- `src/Drivers/OpenAI/Traits/ManagesModels.php` line 59: `'pricing' => ModelPricing::getModelPricing($model->id),`
- `ModelPricing::getModelPricing()` is an instance method being called statically
- OpenAI comprehensive E2E test fails with "Non-static method cannot be called statically"
- Cost calculation completely broken due to method call errors
- Token tracking works (17 tokens recorded) but cost calculation fails

### Desired State
- All cost calculation methods can be called without errors
- OpenAI E2E tests pass without static method errors
- Cost calculation returns positive values for real usage
- Proper instantiation of pricing classes before method calls

### Why This Work is Necessary
This is a fundamental implementation error that prevents cost calculation from working at all. The audit found that while token usage is being tracked correctly, the cost calculation fails immediately due to incorrect method calls. This explains why cost tracking returns 0 - the calculation never completes successfully.

### Evidence from Audit
- OpenAI comprehensive E2E test fails with static method call error
- E2E test shows "Token Tracking: 17 tokens" but cost calculation fails
- `ModelPricing.php` line 231: `public function getModelPricing(string $model): array` (instance method)
- Called statically in `ManagesModels.php` line 59

### Expected Outcomes
- Cost calculation methods execute without fatal errors
- Real cost values are calculated and returned
- E2E tests pass with actual cost calculations
- Proper object-oriented method calling patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `ModelPricing::getModelPricing()` is called as instance method, not static method
- [ ] OpenAI comprehensive E2E test passes without static method errors
- [ ] Cost calculation returns positive values for real API calls
- [ ] All provider cost calculation methods use proper calling patterns
- [ ] Unit tests validate that cost calculation methods can be called without errors
- [ ] E2E tests show real cost values, not 0.0
- [ ] Token usage and cost calculation both work together
- [ ] No fatal errors in any provider cost calculation
- [ ] Cost calculation performance is acceptable
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for cost calculation edge cases

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1061-fix-static-method-call-errors-cost-calculation.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- Template: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Major Features: Budget Cost Tracking, Unified Tool System
- Phases: Audit, Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup
- Format: docs/Planning/Tickets/<Major Feature>/<Phase>/####-short-description.md
- Numbering: 1000s for Budget Cost Tracking, 2000s for Unified Tool System

This is a CRITICAL implementation error that prevents cost calculation from working at all. The audit found that cost tracking returns 0 because cost calculation fails due to static method call errors.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list breaking down all work needed to fix static method call errors
2. Identify all locations where similar static method call errors might exist
3. Plan the proper object instantiation and method calling patterns
4. Suggest unit tests to validate that methods can be called without errors
5. Highlight the critical nature of this fix for cost calculation functionality
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider that this fix is essential for any cost calculation to work.
```

## Notes
This is the second most critical ticket after the test configuration fix. The static method call error is a fundamental implementation bug that prevents cost calculation from working at all.

The audit found that token usage tracking works correctly (17 tokens recorded), but cost calculation fails immediately due to this method call error, which explains why `getTotalCost()` returns 0.0.

## Estimated Effort
Small (< 4 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None (can be fixed independently of other tickets)

## Implementation Details

### Primary Fix Required

#### ManagesModels.php Line 59
```php
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
'pricing' => ModelPricing::getModelPricing($model->id),

// FIXED:
'pricing' => (new ModelPricing())->getModelPricing($model->id),

// OR BETTER (with proper dependency injection):
'pricing' => app(ModelPricing::class)->getModelPricing($model->id),
```

### Method Signature Verification
```php
// src/Drivers/OpenAI/Support/ModelPricing.php line 231
public function getModelPricing(string $model): array
{
    // This is an INSTANCE method, not static
    $normalizedModel = $this->normalizeModelName($model);
    // ...
}
```

### Additional Locations to Check
1. **XAI Provider**: Check for similar static method call patterns
2. **Gemini Provider**: Check for similar static method call patterns
3. **All CalculatesCosts Traits**: Verify proper method calling patterns

### Unit Test to Add
```php
public function test_model_pricing_can_be_called_without_errors()
{
    $pricing = new ModelPricing();
    $result = $pricing->getModelPricing('gpt-3.5-turbo');
    
    $this->assertIsArray($result);
    $this->assertArrayHasKey('input', $result);
    $this->assertArrayHasKey('output', $result);
    $this->assertGreaterThan(0, $result['input']);
    $this->assertGreaterThan(0, $result['output']);
}
```

### Validation Steps
1. Fix the static method call in ManagesModels.php
2. Run OpenAI comprehensive E2E test - should pass without static method errors
3. Run cost calculation tests - should return positive values
4. Verify all providers use proper method calling patterns
5. Add unit tests to prevent regression

# Fix BudgetAlertListener Event Property Compatibility

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1008-fix-budget-alert-listener-compatibility  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Fix BudgetAlertListener Property Access to Match BudgetThresholdReached Event

## Description
The BudgetAlertListener attempts to access properties and methods on BudgetThresholdReached events that don't exist, causing the alert processing system to fail completely. This creates a mismatch between what the listener expects and what the event provides.

**Current State**: Listener tries to access non-existent properties like `$event->thresholdPercentage`, `$event->projectId`, `$event->getSeverity()`, causing fatal errors during event processing.

**Desired State**: Listener correctly accesses all event properties using the actual property names and methods available on the BudgetThresholdReached event.

**Root Cause**: The listener was written expecting a different event interface than what the BudgetThresholdReached event actually provides. Property names and method signatures don't match.

**Impact**: 
- Budget alert processing completely fails
- No budget threshold notifications are sent
- Alert configuration testing fails
- Budget monitoring system is non-functional

**Dependencies**: This ticket depends on ticket 1107 (Fix BudgetThresholdReached Constructor) being completed first, as the constructor changes will affect available properties.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BudgetAlertListener correctly accesses all BudgetThresholdReached event properties:
  - [ ] Replace `$event->thresholdPercentage` with `$event->percentage` (or new property name from 1107)
  - [ ] Replace `$event->getSeverity()` with `$event->severity` property access
  - [ ] Handle missing `$event->projectId` gracefully (check if property exists)
  - [ ] Handle missing `$event->organizationId` gracefully (check if property exists)
  - [ ] Handle missing `$event->additionalCost` gracefully (check if property exists)
  - [ ] Handle missing `$event->metadata` gracefully (check if property exists)
- [ ] Listener processes events without fatal errors
- [ ] Alert notifications are successfully created and sent
- [ ] Alert configuration testing works correctly
- [ ] Proper error handling for missing or invalid event properties
- [ ] Logging includes correct event property values
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking works with correct property access
- [ ] All unit tests pass with corrected property access
- [ ] All integration tests pass with functional alert processing
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained if event properties change

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list breaking down all work needed to complete this ticket
2. Identify the specific property mismatches that need to be fixed
3. Plan graceful handling for properties that may not exist
4. Design error handling strategy for invalid event data
5. Consider the dependency on ticket 1107 and how constructor changes affect this work
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Focus on:
- Analyzing current property access vs available event properties
- Planning defensive programming for missing properties
- Updating all property access to use correct names
- Ensuring robust error handling and logging
- Maintaining alert functionality while fixing compatibility issues

This ticket is CRITICAL and depends on ticket 1107 being completed first.
```

## Notes
This ticket must be completed after ticket 1107 as the constructor changes will affect which properties are available on the event. The listener needs to be updated to handle both the current event structure and any changes made in ticket 1107.

**Property Access Strategy**:
1. Use actual property names from the event
2. Add defensive checks for optional properties
3. Provide fallback values for missing properties
4. Log warnings for unexpected property access patterns

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Graceful degradation when properties are missing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fallback alert processing when possible
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

## Estimated Effort
Small (2-3 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1107 - Fix BudgetThresholdReached Constructor (must be completed first)

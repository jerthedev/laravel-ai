## Title
Fix Provider Cost Calculation Fatal Errors in OpenAI and Gemini Drivers

## Description
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The audit revealed that OpenAI and Gemini drivers have fatal errors in their cost calculation methods due to calling non-existent static methods. While the event system masks these errors through error handling, they prevent proper event-based cost aggregation and cause Gemini driver to be completely non-functional.

**Current State**:
- **OpenAI Driver**: Calls `ModelPricing::estimateCost()` and `ModelPricing::getModelPricing()` as static methods (lines 39, 75, 90)
- **Gemini Driver**: Same static method call errors prevent any API calls from completing
- **XAI Driver**: Has field name mismatches (`input_per_1m` vs `input`) preventing cost calculation
- Fatal errors masked by system-level error handling but break event-based cost aggregation
- Real API test shows: "Non-static method cannot be called statically"

**Desired State**:
- All provider cost calculation methods work correctly for event-based aggregation
- OpenAI and Gemini drivers can execute without fatal errors
- XAI driver calculates costs accurately with correct field names
- Event-based cost aggregation receives accurate cost data
- Provider-level cost calculation serves event system (separate from response-level costs)

**Root Causes**:
1. **Static Method Calls**: Calling instance methods as static methods
2. **Field Name Mismatches**: XAI expects different field names than provided
3. **Architecture Confusion**: Provider cost calculation should serve events, not responses

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1017-fix-provider-cost-calculation-fatal-errors.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CRITICAL CONTEXT: The audit revealed specific fatal errors in provider cost calculation:
1. OpenAI: Calls ModelPricing::estimateCost() as static (lines 39, 75, 90) - method doesn't exist as static
2. Gemini: Same static method call errors prevent execution
3. XAI: Expects $pricing['input_per_1m'] but data provides $pricing['input']

ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Provider cost calculation serves the EVENT SYSTEM for aggregation, not response-level costs (that's handled by ticket 1016).

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for fixing all provider cost calculation errors
2. Identify the correct way to call ModelPricing methods (instance vs static)
3. Plan the field name corrections for XAI driver
4. Design unit tests to prevent regression of these errors
5. Plan verification strategy using real API tests
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider error handling, backward compatibility, and testing strategy.
```

## Notes
- Provider cost calculation serves EVENT SYSTEM for aggregation (not response-level costs)
- OpenAI and Gemini have identical static method call errors
- XAI has different issue: field name mismatches in cost calculation
- Real API tests prove the errors exist and impact event-based cost aggregation
- Must maintain separation between provider-level (events) and response-level (immediate) costs

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Understanding of ModelPricing class architecture (instance vs static methods)
- [ ] Access to real API credentials for testing fixes
- [ ] Event system must be working to verify cost aggregation improvements

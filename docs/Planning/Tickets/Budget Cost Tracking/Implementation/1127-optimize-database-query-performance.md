# Optimize Database Query Performance

**Date Created**: 2025-01-27

## Title
Optimize Database Query Performance for Cost Tracking and Budget Operations

## Description
The performance analysis identified critical query performance bottlenecks in cost tracking and budget services. Heavy aggregation queries, inefficient date filtering, and missing composite indexes are causing significant performance issues that will impact production scalability.

**Current State:**
- Heavy aggregation queries without result limits cause full table scans
- Date filtering uses functions (DATE(), YEAR(), MONTH()) that prevent index usage
- Missing composite indexes for common query patterns
- JSON path queries cannot use indexes
- N+1 query patterns in budget checking operations

**Desired State:**
- Optimized queries with proper indexing and result limiting
- Date range filtering that uses indexes effectively
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Efficient budget checking with minimal database round trips
- Query performance suitable for production scale

**Performance Issues Identified:**
1. **Heavy Aggregation Queries**: Multiple SUM/COUNT operations on large tables
2. **Date Function Queries**: DATE(), YEAR(), MONTH() prevent index usage
3. **Missing Composite Indexes**: Common query patterns lack optimal indexes
4. **JSON Path Queries**: Cannot use indexes, require full table scans
5. **N+1 Query Patterns**: Multiple separate queries instead of JOINs

# Fix Phantom Table References

**Date Created**: 2025-01-27

## Title
Fix Phantom Table References in Cost Tracking Code

## Description
The code analysis revealed that `CostTrackingListener` references a non-existent table `ai_cost_tracking`, which causes silent failures in cost tracking functionality. This is a critical production blocker that prevents proper cost tracking from working.

**Current State:**
- `CostTrackingListener` attempts to insert into `ai_cost_tracking` table
- Table `ai_cost_tracking` does not exist in database schema
- Cost tracking fails silently, leading to missing cost data
- No error handling for the missing table scenario

**Desired State:**
- All table references point to existing tables
- Cost tracking functionality works correctly
- Proper error handling for database operations
- Consistent table naming throughout the codebase

**Root Cause:**
The code was written expecting an `ai_cost_tracking` table, but the actual implementation uses `ai_usage_costs` table. This mismatch causes database insertion failures.

**Impact:**
- Cost tracking data is not being recorded
- Budget enforcement may not work correctly due to missing cost data
- Analytics and reporting will have incomplete data
- Silent failures make debugging difficult

# Implementation Ticket 1023

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1023-implement-missing-services-referenced-in-specifications  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Implement Missing Services Referenced in Specifications

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY COMPLETENESS ISSUE**: The audit revealed that several services are referenced in specifications and documentation but are not implemented. This creates a gap between documented architecture and actual implementation, potentially confusing developers and missing architectural components.

**Current State**:
- **TokenUsageExtractor**: Referenced in specifications but missing from `src/Services/`
- **CostCalculationService**: Referenced in specifications but missing from `src/Services/`
- Existing services: BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, PricingService exist
- Documentation references services that don't exist
- Architecture incomplete compared to specifications

**Desired State**:
- All services referenced in specifications are implemented
- TokenUsageExtractor provides centralized token extraction logic
- CostCalculationService provides centralized cost calculation utilities
- Complete service architecture matching specifications
- Clear separation of concerns between services

**Architecture Requirements**:
- TokenUsageExtractor: Centralized logic for extracting token usage from provider responses
- CostCalculationService: Centralized utilities for cost calculation across providers
- Integration with existing services (BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, PricingService)
- Follow established service patterns and dependency injection
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TokenUsageExtractor service implemented with centralized token extraction logic
- [ ] CostCalculationService service implemented with centralized cost calculation utilities
- [ ] Services registered in LaravelAIServiceProvider with proper dependency injection
- [ ] Integration with existing services (BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, PricingService)
- [ ] Services follow established patterns and coding standards
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage for all service methods
- [ ] Integration tests verify service interactions work correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect complete service architecture
- [ ] Services are used by appropriate components (providers, middleware, etc.)
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for service operations

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1023-implement-missing-services-referenced-in-specifications.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

COMPLETENESS ISSUE: Services referenced in specifications but not implemented:
1. TokenUsageExtractor - Centralized token extraction logic
2. CostCalculationService - Centralized cost calculation utilities

EXISTING SERVICES FOR REFERENCE:
- BudgetService
- CostAnalyticsService  
- PricingService

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Follow established service patterns
2. Integrate with existing services
3. Provide centralized utilities for token extraction and cost calculation
4. Register with dependency injection container
5. Comprehensive testing

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for implementing missing services
2. Design the TokenUsageExtractor service architecture and methods
3. Design the CostCalculationService service architecture and methods
4. Plan integration with existing services and components
5. Plan comprehensive testing strategy
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider service architecture, dependency injection, and integration points.
```

## Notes
- Completes the service architecture referenced in specifications
- TokenUsageExtractor could centralize token extraction logic from providers
- CostCalculationService could provide utilities for cost calculation
- Should integrate with existing services and follow established patterns
- Lower priority than core cost tracking fixes but important for architecture completeness

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Understanding of existing service patterns (BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, PricingService)
- [ ] Service registration patterns in LaravelAIServiceProvider
- [ ] Integration points with providers and middleware
- [ ] Specifications that reference these services

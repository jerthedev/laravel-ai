# Fix BudgetThresholdReached Event Constructor Mismatch

## Title
Fix BudgetThresholdReached Event Constructor to Match Middleware Usage

## Description
The BudgetThresholdReached event has a critical constructor mismatch that prevents it from being dispatched by middleware and services. This breaks the entire budget alert system as events fail with fatal errors when attempting to instantiate with parameters that don't exist in the constructor.

**Current State**: Event constructor has 6 parameters but middleware attempts to pass 9 parameters, including several that don't exist, causing fatal "Unknown named parameter" errors.

**Desired State**: Event constructor accepts all parameters used by middleware and services, allowing successful event dispatching and budget alert processing.

**Root Cause**: The event was designed with a simplified constructor, but middleware and services evolved to pass additional context data (projectId, organizationId, additionalCost, metadata) that the constructor doesn't support.

**Impact**: 
- Budget enforcement middleware fails when dispatching threshold events
- Cost tracking listeners fail when checking budget thresholds  
- Budget alert service fails when testing configurations
- Entire budget alert system is non-functional

**Dependencies**: This is a foundational fix required before any other budget-related functionality can work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BudgetThresholdReached constructor accepts all parameters used by middleware:
  - [ ] userId (int) - existing
  - [ ] budgetType (string) - existing  
  - [ ] currentSpending (float) - existing
  - [ ] budgetLimit (float) - existing
  - [ ] additionalCost (float) - NEW required parameter
  - [ ] thresholdPercentage (float) - rename from 'percentage'
  - [ ] projectId (?string) - NEW optional parameter
  - [ ] organizationId (?string) - NEW optional parameter
  - [ ] metadata (array) - NEW optional parameter with default empty array
  - [ ] severity (string) - existing, make optional with default calculation
- [ ] All existing event instantiations continue to work (backward compatibility)
- [ ] BudgetEnforcementMiddleware can successfully dispatch events without errors
- [ ] CostTrackingListener can successfully dispatch events without errors
- [ ] BudgetAlertService test methods can successfully create events without errors
- [ ] Event properties are accessible by listeners using correct names
- [ ] All unit tests pass with new constructor
- [ ] All integration tests pass with functional event dispatching
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 1ms additional overhead)

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in event systems. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/1007-fix-budget-threshold-reached-constructor.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- Template: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Major Features: Budget Cost Tracking, Unified Tool System
- Phases: Audit, Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup
- Format: docs/Planning/Tickets/<Major Feature>/<Phase>/####-short-description.md
- Numbering: 1000s for Budget Cost Tracking, 2000s for Unified Tool System

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list breaking down all work needed to complete this ticket
2. Identify any dependencies or prerequisites (this is a foundational fix)
3. Suggest the order of execution for maximum efficiency
4. Highlight any potential risks or challenges with constructor changes
5. Consider backward compatibility requirements for existing code
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Focus on:
- Analyzing current constructor vs required parameters
- Planning backward-compatible constructor changes
- Updating all usage locations to use correct parameter names
- Ensuring listener compatibility with new event properties
- Comprehensive testing of the fixed event system

This is a CRITICAL fix that unblocks the entire budget tracking system.
```

## Notes
This is the highest priority ticket as it unblocks all other budget-related functionality. The constructor change must maintain backward compatibility while adding support for the additional parameters used by middleware.

**Constructor Change Strategy**:
1. Add new optional parameters with defaults
2. Maintain existing parameter order where possible
3. Rename 'percentage' to 'thresholdPercentage' for consistency
4. Add automatic severity calculation if not provided

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Extensive testing with both old and new parameter patterns
- Gradual rollout with feature flags if needed
- Comprehensive error handling for parameter validation

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-6 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is the foundational fix that other tickets depend on

# Refactor Manual Test Data Creation

**Ticket ID**: Test Cleanup/1043-refactor-manual-test-data-creation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Refactor Manual Test Data Creation to Use Model Factories

## Description
The test analysis revealed extensive manual test data creation using raw array insertions instead of proper model factories. This creates maintenance overhead, inconsistent test data, and duplicated seeding logic across multiple test files.

**Current State:**
- Manual array-based test data creation in multiple test files
- Duplicated seeding logic across CostAnalyticsServiceTest, CostTrackingListenerTest, etc.
- Inconsistent test data patterns and values
- Difficult to maintain and update test data structures

**Desired State:**
- Consistent use of model factories for all test data generation
- Reusable factory methods for common test scenarios
- Eliminated duplication of test data creation logic
- Maintainable and consistent test data across all test files

**Manual Data Creation Patterns to Refactor:**
1. **Cost Record Arrays** - Raw array insertions in analytics tests
2. **Budget Data Arrays** - Manual budget creation in service tests
3. **Alert Data Arrays** - Manual alert data in alert service tests
4. **Pricing Data Arrays** - Manual pricing data in cost calculation tests

**Files with Manual Data Creation:**
- `CostBreakdownAnalyticsTest.php` - 50+ lines of manual cost data arrays
- `CostTrackingPerformanceTest.php` - Manual cost data generation
- `CostAnalyticsServiceTest.php` - Manual cost and pricing data
- `CostCalculationEngineTest.php` - Manual pricing data arrays

## Notes
- Preserve existing test behavior while improving maintainability
- Create factory states for common test scenarios (high cost, low cost, etc.)
- Consider performance impact of factory usage vs manual arrays
- Ensure factory-generated data is realistic and follows business rules

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 1012-create-missing-eloquent-models - Models must exist for factories
- [ ] Missing model factories must be created (CostRecordFactory, BudgetFactory, etc.)

# Optimize Test Performance and Organization

**Ticket ID**: Test Cleanup/1044-optimize-test-performance-and-organization  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Optimize Test Performance and Organization for Cost Tracking Test Suite

## Description
The test suite needs optimization for performance and better organization to support efficient development workflows. Current tests may have performance issues, inconsistent organization, and could benefit from better categorization and parallel execution strategies.

**Current State:**
- Test execution time may be suboptimal
- Inconsistent test organization across feature areas
- No systematic performance monitoring for test suite
- Limited parallel test execution optimization
- Test categories not clearly defined for selective execution

**Desired State:**
- Optimized test performance with faster execution times
- Well-organized test suite with clear categorization
- Performance monitoring and reporting for test suite
- Efficient parallel test execution
- Clear test categories for selective execution (unit, feature, integration, E2E)

**Optimization Areas:**
1. **Test Performance** - Reduce execution time through optimization
2. **Test Organization** - Consistent directory structure and naming
3. **Test Categorization** - Clear separation of test types
4. **Parallel Execution** - Optimize for parallel test running
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Track test suite performance over time

# Optimize Event System Test Performance and Maintenance

**Ticket ID**: Test Cleanup/1040-optimize-event-system-test-performance  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Optimize Event System Test Performance and Maintainability

## Description
After implementing comprehensive event system tests, optimize test performance, reduce execution time, and improve maintainability. This includes identifying slow tests, implementing efficient test patterns, and creating reusable test utilities that make the test suite faster and easier to maintain.

**Current State**: Comprehensive test suite exists but may have performance issues, duplicate code, and maintenance challenges typical of newly implemented test suites.

**Desired State**: Optimized test suite that runs quickly, has minimal duplication, uses efficient testing patterns, and is easy to maintain and extend.

**Root Cause**: Initial test implementation focused on coverage and correctness rather than performance and maintainability optimization.

**Impact**: 
- Faster test execution improves developer productivity
- Better test maintainability reduces long-term maintenance costs
- Efficient test patterns improve reliability
- Optimized resource usage reduces CI/CD costs

**Dependencies**: This ticket should be completed after all test implementation tickets (1030+) to optimize the complete test suite.

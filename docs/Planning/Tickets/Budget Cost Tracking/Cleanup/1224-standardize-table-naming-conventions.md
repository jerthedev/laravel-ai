# Standardize Table Naming Conventions

**Ticket ID**: Cleanup/1024-standardize-table-naming-conventions  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Standardize Table Naming Conventions to Match Specification Requirements

## Description
The specification compliance analysis revealed critical table naming mismatches that prevent full specification compliance. The current implementation uses different table names than specified, which can cause integration issues, API compatibility problems, and documentation inconsistencies.

**Current State:**
- `ai_usage_costs` table should be `ai_cost_records` per specification
- `ai_budgets` table should be `ai_user_budgets` per specification
- Inconsistent naming creates specification compliance issues
- API documentation and service integration may reference incorrect table names

**Desired State:**
- All table names match the specification exactly
- Consistent naming conventions across all cost/budget tables
- Full specification compliance for table naming
- Updated code references to use correct table names

**Naming Changes Required:**
1. `ai_usage_costs` → `ai_cost_records`
2. `ai_budgets` → `ai_user_budgets`

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: Table renames are straightforward with proper migration
- **Code Updates**: All model references and queries need updating
- **Documentation**: API docs and specifications need alignment

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list breaking down all work needed to complete this ticket
2. Identify any dependencies or prerequisites
3. Suggest the order of execution for maximum efficiency
4. Highlight any potential risks or challenges
5. If this is an AUDIT ticket, plan the creation of subsequent phase tickets using the template
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Important: Backward compatibility is not necessary since this package has not yet been released. We want consistent patterns throughout the project.

Please be thorough and consider all aspects of Laravel development including code implementation, testing, documentation, and integration.
```

## Notes
- Table renames should be done in maintenance windows to avoid conflicts
- Consider creating views with old names for backward compatibility during transition
- Update all documentation and API references
- Coordinate with any external integrations that may reference table names

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 1012-create-missing-eloquent-models - Models should exist before renaming tables
- [ ] Coordination with any external systems that reference current table names

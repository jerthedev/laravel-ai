# Cleanup Ticket 1029

**Ticket ID**: Cleanup/1029-standardize-provider-error-handling-code-patterns  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Standardize Provider Error Handling and Code Patterns

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY CODE QUALITY ISSUE**: The audit revealed inconsistencies in provider implementations, particularly in error handling, cost calculation patterns, and code organization. While all providers follow the trait-based architecture, there are subtle differences in implementation patterns that should be standardized for maintainability.

**Current State**:
- Provider error handling varies in approach and consistency
- Cost calculation patterns differ between providers (static vs instance methods)
- Code organization within traits varies between providers
- Error mapping strategies are inconsistent
- Some providers have more comprehensive error handling than others

**Desired State**:
- Consistent error handling patterns across all providers
- Standardized cost calculation approach (instance methods, not static)
- Uniform code organization within traits
- Consistent error mapping and exception handling
- Standardized logging and debugging patterns

**Inconsistencies Identified**:
1. **Cost Calculation**: OpenAI/Gemini use static calls (incorrect), XAI uses instance methods
2. **Error Handling**: Different approaches to API error mapping and exception handling
3. **Code Organization**: Trait method organization varies between providers
4. **Logging**: Inconsistent logging patterns and debug information
5. **Validation**: Different validation approaches for API responses

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/1029-standardize-provider-error-handling-code-patterns.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CONTEXT: The audit revealed inconsistencies in provider implementations:
- Cost calculation: OpenAI/Gemini use static calls (incorrect), XAI uses instance methods (correct)
- Error handling varies in approach and consistency
- Code organization within traits varies between providers
- Different validation and logging approaches

STANDARDIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fix static method calls in OpenAI/Gemini cost calculation
2. Standardize error handling patterns across all providers
3. Uniform code organization within traits
4. Consistent error mapping and exception handling
5. Standardized logging and debugging patterns

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for standardizing provider patterns
2. Design the standardized cost calculation pattern (instance methods)
3. Plan consistent error handling and mapping patterns
4. Design uniform trait organization and naming conventions
5. Plan validation and testing strategy for consistency
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider maintainability, consistency, and code quality.
```

## Notes
- Addresses the static method call errors identified in audit (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Should use XAI provider as reference for correct instance method patterns
- Critical for maintainability and consistency across providers
- Should update driver templates to prevent future inconsistencies

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Implementation ticket 1017 (Fix Provider Cost Calculation Fatal Errors) should be completed first
- [ ] Understanding of correct provider patterns from audit findings
- [ ] Driver templates for standardized patterns
- [ ] All provider implementations for comparison and standardization

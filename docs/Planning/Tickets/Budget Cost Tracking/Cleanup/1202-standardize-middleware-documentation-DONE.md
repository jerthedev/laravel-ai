# Standardize Middleware Documentation

**Ticket ID**: Cleanup/1202-standardize-middleware-documentation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Standardize Middleware Documentation and Code Comments

## Description
Standardize documentation and code comments across all middleware classes to ensure consistent, comprehensive documentation that follows Laravel and package standards.

**Current State**: 
- Inconsistent documentation across middleware classes
- Missing or incomplete PHPDoc comments
- No standardized documentation format for middleware
- Limited usage examples and configuration documentation

**Desired State**:
- Consistent PHPDoc comments across all middleware classes
- Comprehensive class and method documentation
- Standardized documentation format following Laravel conventions
- Complete usage examples and configuration documentation
- Updated README and specification documentation

**Critical Issues Addressed**:
- Improves code maintainability and developer experience
- Provides clear documentation for middleware usage and configuration
- Ensures consistent documentation standards across the package
- Facilitates easier onboarding for new developers

**Dependencies**:
- Requires all Implementation phase tickets to be completed
- Requires functional middleware system for accurate documentation
- Should be done after performance optimization to document final implementation

## Implementation Details

### PHPDoc Standards
```php
/**
 * Budget Enforcement Middleware
 * 
 * Enforces budget limits for AI requests at user, project, and organization levels.
 * Checks budget limits before processing requests and throws BudgetExceededException
 * when limits would be exceeded. Fires BudgetThresholdReached events when usage
 * approaches configured thresholds (80% and 95%).
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - ai.middleware.budget_enforcement.daily_limit: Daily budget limit per user
 * - ai.middleware.budget_enforcement.monthly_limit: Monthly budget limit per user
 * - ai.middleware.budget_enforcement.per_request_limit: Maximum cost per request
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```php
 * // Via ConversationBuilder
 * $response = AI::conversation()
 *     ->middleware('budget-enforcement')
 *     ->send('Generate report');
 * 
 * // Via Direct SendMessage
 * $response = AI::provider('openai')->sendMessage('Hello', [
 *     'middleware' => ['budget-enforcement']
 * ]);
 * ```
 * 
 * @package JTD\LaravelAI\Middleware
 * @author JTD Laravel AI Package
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
class BudgetEnforcementMiddleware implements AIMiddlewareInterface
{
    /**
     * Handle the AI request through budget enforcement middleware.
     * 
     * Checks user, project, and organization budget limits before processing
     * the request. If any limit would be exceeded, throws BudgetExceededException.
     * Fires BudgetThresholdReached events when usage approaches thresholds.
     * 
     * @param AIRequest $request The AI request to process
     * @param Closure $next The next middleware in the pipeline
     * 
     * @return AIResponse The AI response after budget enforcement
     * 
     * @throws BudgetExceededException When budget limits would be exceeded
     * @throws InvalidArgumentException When request data is invalid
     * 
     * @since 1.0.0
     */
    public function handle(AIRequest $request, Closure $next): AIResponse
    {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

### Configuration Documentation
```php
// config/ai.php
'middleware' => [
    'enabled' => env('AI_MIDDLEWARE_ENABLED', true),
    
    /**
     * Global Middleware
     * 
     * Middleware that executes for all AI requests when middleware is enabled.
     * These middleware run in the order specified and cannot be disabled
     * for individual requests.
     * 
     * Available middleware:
     * - 'cost-tracking': Tracks and calculates costs for all AI requests
     * - 'budget-enforcement': Enforces budget limits and prevents overruns
     */
    'global' => [
        'cost-tracking',
        'budget-enforcement',
    ],
    
    /**
     * Available Middleware
     * 
     * Middleware that can be used optionally via ConversationBuilder or
     * Direct SendMessage patterns. Maps middleware names to class references.
     */
    'available' => [
        'cost-tracking' => \JTD\LaravelAI\Middleware\CostTrackingMiddleware::class,
        'budget-enforcement' => \JTD\LaravelAI\Middleware\BudgetEnforcementMiddleware::class,
    ],
],
```

### README Documentation
```markdown
## Middleware System

The Laravel AI package includes a powerful middleware system for cost tracking, budget enforcement, and request processing.

### Available Middleware

#### Cost Tracking Middleware
Automatically tracks costs for all AI requests and fires `CostCalculated` events.

#### Budget Enforcement Middleware  
Enforces budget limits at user, project, and organization levels.

### Usage Examples

#### ConversationBuilder Pattern
```php
$response = AI::conversation()
    ->middleware(['cost-tracking', 'budget-enforcement'])
    ->send('Generate a report');
```

#### Direct SendMessage Pattern
```php
$response = AI::provider('openai')->sendMessage('Hello', [
    'middleware' => ['budget-enforcement']
]);
```

### Configuration
Configure middleware in `config/ai.php`:

```php
'middleware' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'global' => ['cost-tracking'],
    'available' => [
        'budget-enforcement' => BudgetEnforcementMiddleware::class,
    ],
],
```
```

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/1202-standardize-middleware-documentation.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

This ticket standardizes documentation across the middleware system to ensure consistent, comprehensive documentation following Laravel standards.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for standardizing middleware documentation
2. Plan PHPDoc comment standards for all middleware classes and methods
3. Design configuration documentation with examples and explanations
4. Plan README updates with middleware usage examples
5. Design documentation validation to ensure completeness
6. Plan specification updates with implementation details
7. Ensure documentation follows Laravel and PSR standards

Important: Backward compatibility is not necessary since this package has not yet been released.  We want consistent patterns throughout the project.

Focus on creating clear, comprehensive documentation that improves developer experience and code maintainability.
```

## Notes
This cleanup ticket ensures the middleware system has professional, consistent documentation that makes it easy for developers to understand and use the middleware functionality.

## Estimated Effort
Small (0.5 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] All Implementation phase tickets must be completed
- [ ] Performance optimization should be completed for accurate documentation
- [ ] Functional middleware system required for accurate examples

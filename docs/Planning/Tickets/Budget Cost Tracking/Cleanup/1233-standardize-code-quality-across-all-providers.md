**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Standardize Code Quality Across All Providers

## Description
**LOW PRIORITY CODE QUALITY ISSUE**: While all providers follow the trait-based architecture, there are variations in code quality, documentation standards, type hints, and coding patterns. Standardizing these aspects will improve maintainability and consistency across the codebase.

**Current State**:
- Inconsistent documentation standards across providers
- Varying levels of type hints and return type declarations
- Different coding style patterns between providers
- Inconsistent method naming and organization
- Varying levels of inline documentation and comments

**Desired State**:
- Consistent documentation standards across all providers
- Complete type hints and return type declarations
- Uniform coding style and patterns
- Consistent method naming and organization
- Comprehensive inline documentation and comments

**Code Quality Areas**:
1. **Documentation**: Standardize PHPDoc blocks and inline comments
2. **Type Hints**: Complete type hints for all method parameters and return types
3. **Coding Style**: Ensure consistent coding style across all providers
4. **Method Organization**: Standardize method order and organization within traits
5. **Error Messages**: Consistent error message formats and logging

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/1033-standardize-code-quality-across-all-providers.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CONTEXT: While all providers follow trait-based architecture, there are variations in code quality, documentation standards, type hints, and coding patterns that should be standardized.

CODE QUALITY AREAS:
1. Documentation: Standardize PHPDoc blocks and inline comments
2. Type Hints: Complete type hints for all parameters and return types
3. Coding Style: Ensure consistent style across all providers
4. Method Organization: Standardize method order within traits
5. Error Messages: Consistent error message formats

STANDARDIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Complete PHPDoc blocks for all methods
- Full type hints and return type declarations
- Consistent coding style (PHP CS Fixer compliance)
- Standardized method organization and naming
- Comprehensive static analysis compliance

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for standardizing code quality
2. Design code quality standards for provider implementations
3. Plan documentation and type hint standardization
4. Design automated quality checking and enforcement
5. Plan validation strategy for code quality improvements
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider maintainability, consistency, and automated quality enforcement.
```

## Notes
- Lower priority but important for long-term maintainability
- Should use automated tools (PHP CS Fixer, PHPStan) for enforcement
- Should establish standards that apply to future provider implementations
- Important for code review consistency and developer onboarding

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] All provider implementations (including Ollama after ticket 1020)
- [ ] Coding standards and style guide documentation
- [ ] Automated code quality tools (PHP CS Fixer, PHPStan)
- [ ] Understanding of current code quality variations across providers

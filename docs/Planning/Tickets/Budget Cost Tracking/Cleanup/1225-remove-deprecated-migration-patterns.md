# Remove Deprecated Migration Patterns

**Ticket ID**: Cleanup/1025-remove-deprecated-migration-patterns  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Remove Deprecated Migration Patterns and Commented-Out Foreign Keys

## Description
The migration analysis revealed several deprecated patterns and commented-out foreign key constraints that create uncertainty and technical debt. These commented-out constraints indicate incomplete implementation and should be either properly implemented or removed entirely.

**Current State:**
- Multiple migration files have commented-out foreign key constraints
- Inconsistent foreign key implementation patterns
- Uncertainty about whether constraints should be enabled
- Technical debt in migration files

**Desired State:**
- All foreign key constraints are either properly implemented or removed
- Consistent migration patterns across all files
- Clear migration history without deprecated patterns
- Proper foreign key constraint implementation

**Deprecated Patterns Identified:**
1. **Commented-out foreign keys** in performance and optimization tracking tables
2. **Inconsistent constraint naming** across migration files
3. **Optional foreign keys** with unclear implementation status

**Files with Deprecated Patterns:**
- `ai_performance_alerts` table - commented foreign keys to users
- `ai_optimization_tracking` table - commented foreign keys to users
- Various tables with inconsistent constraint patterns

## Notes
- Decision needed on whether user table foreign keys should be implemented
- Consider impact on existing data when implementing previously commented constraints
- Ensure migration rollback functionality works correctly
- Document decisions about constraint implementation

## Estimated Effort
Small (< 4 hours)

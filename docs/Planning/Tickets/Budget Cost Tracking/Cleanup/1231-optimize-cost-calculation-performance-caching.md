# Cleanup Ticket 1031

**Ticket ID**: Cleanup/1031-optimize-cost-calculation-performance-caching  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Optimize Cost Calculation Performance and Caching

## Description
**MEDIUM PRIORITY PERFORMANCE ISSUE**: With the implementation of database-first cost calculation (ticket 1016), there will be database queries for every cost calculation. This could impact performance, especially for high-volume applications. Implementing intelligent caching and performance optimizations will be critical for production use.

**Current State**:
- Cost calculation will query database for every request (after ticket 1016)
- No caching strategy for frequently accessed pricing data
- Database queries for model pricing on every cost calculation
- Potential performance bottleneck for high-volume applications
- No performance monitoring for cost calculation operations

**Desired State**:
- Intelligent caching strategy for pricing data
- Optimized database queries for cost calculation
- Performance monitoring and metrics for cost operations
- Configurable caching TTL and strategies
- Minimal performance impact for cost calculation (< 50ms target)

**Performance Optimizations Needed**:
1. **Pricing Data Caching**: Cache frequently accessed model pricing data
2. **Database Query Optimization**: Optimize queries for cost calculation
3. **Batch Operations**: Support batch cost calculations for multiple requests
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics and monitoring for cost operations
5. **Configurable Caching**: Allow configuration of caching strategies and TTL

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/1031-optimize-cost-calculation-performance-caching.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

CONTEXT: After implementing database-first cost calculation (ticket 1016), there will be database queries for every cost calculation, which could impact performance for high-volume applications.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Intelligent caching strategy for pricing data
2. Optimized database queries for cost calculation
3. Performance monitoring and metrics
4. Target: < 50ms for cached data, < 200ms for uncached data
5. Support for high-volume applications

OPTIMIZATION AREAS:
- Pricing data caching with configurable TTL
- Database query optimization
- Batch operations for multiple requests
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Configurable caching strategies

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for optimizing cost calculation performance
2. Design intelligent caching strategy for pricing data
3. Plan database query optimizations
4. Design performance monitoring and metrics
5. Plan high-volume testing and benchmarking
6. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with implementation

Please be thorough and consider scalability, caching strategies, and performance monitoring.
```

## Notes
- Critical for production performance after database-first cost calculation implementation
- Should support multiple caching backends (Redis, file, database)
- Important for high-volume applications and API usage
- Should include performance benchmarks and monitoring

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ticket 1016: Database-first cost calculation must be implemented first
- [ ] Understanding of cost calculation query patterns and frequency
- [ ] Caching infrastructure (Redis, etc.) for optimal performance
- [ ] Performance testing tools and benchmarking capabilities

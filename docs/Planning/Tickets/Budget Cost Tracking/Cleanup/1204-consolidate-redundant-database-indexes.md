# Consolidate Redundant Database Indexes

**Ticket ID**: Cleanup/1023-consolidate-redundant-database-indexes  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Consolidate Redundant Database Indexes for Improved Performance and Maintenance

## Description
The database index analysis revealed that while indexing is comprehensive, there are redundant and potentially conflicting indexes that can impact write performance and increase maintenance overhead. Some tables have over-indexing with single-column indexes that are redundant when composite indexes exist.

**Current State:**
- Multiple redundant single-column indexes where composite indexes exist
- Over-indexing on some tables impacting write performance
- Inconsistent indexing patterns across similar tables
- High index maintenance overhead during data modifications

**Desired State:**
- Optimized index strategy with minimal redundancy
- Consistent indexing patterns across all cost/budget tables
- Improved write performance through reduced index overhead
- Maintained or improved query performance

**Redundant Indexes Identified:**
1. **ai_usage_costs**: Single column indexes redundant with composite indexes
2. **ai_budget_alerts**: Multiple overlapping indexes for similar query patterns
3. **ai_cost_analytics**: Some indexes may be redundant with query patterns

**Benefits:**
- Improved write performance (INSERT/UPDATE operations)
- Reduced storage overhead
- Simplified index maintenance
- Consistent indexing strategy

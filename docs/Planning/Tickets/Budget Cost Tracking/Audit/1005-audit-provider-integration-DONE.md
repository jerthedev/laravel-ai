## Title
Audit AI Provider Integration for Cost Tracking

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive audit of AI provider integration to ensure cost tracking works correctly with all supported providers (OpenAI, XAI, Gemini). This audit will assess how well the current provider implementations extract token usage and support cost calculation.

The audit must determine:
- Whether all supported providers (OpenAI, XAI, Gemini) can extract token usage from responses
- Whether provider-specific cost calculation rates are configured correctly
- Whether the AI Facade correctly routes requests through cost tracking middleware
- Whether provider responses contain the necessary data for cost calculation
- Whether the ConversationBuilder and Direct SendMessage patterns work with cost tracking
- What provider-specific issues prevent accurate cost calculation

This audit is critical because E2E testing revealed that costs always return 0, which may be due to provider integration issues preventing proper token usage extraction.

Expected outcomes:
- Assessment of token usage extraction for each supported provider
- Evaluation of provider-specific cost calculation rates and configuration
- Analysis of AI Facade integration with cost tracking middleware
- Testing of both ConversationBuilder and Direct SendMessage patterns
- Gap analysis with provider-specific remediation recommendations
- Creation of subsequent implementation tickets based on findings

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in AI provider integration and API communication. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Audit/1005-audit-provider-integration.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Template Location: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/ (numbering 1011+)
- Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/ (numbering 1024+)
- Test Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/ (numbering 1034+)
- Test Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Cleanup/ (numbering 1044+)
- Each ticket must be as detailed as this audit ticket with comprehensive descriptions, related files, tests, and acceptance criteria

This is an AUDIT ticket - your goal is to assess the current state and create subsequent implementation tickets, not to implement changes.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for auditing AI provider integration
2. Include specific steps for testing token usage extraction with each provider
3. Plan how to assess provider-specific cost calculation and rate configuration
4. Design evaluation approach for AI Facade and pattern integration
5. Plan testing with real provider responses to identify token usage issues
6. Plan the gap analysis approach and documentation format
7. Plan the creation of ALL FOUR PHASES of tickets (Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup) based on audit findings
8. Each phase ticket must be as comprehensive as this audit ticket with full details
9. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with the audit

Focus on identifying why token usage extraction and cost calculation fail with real providers and comprehensive ticket creation for all subsequent phases.
```

## Notes
Provider integration is critical for accurate cost tracking. This audit will determine whether the issue is in provider communication, token extraction, or cost calculation logic.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - can be done in parallel with other audits

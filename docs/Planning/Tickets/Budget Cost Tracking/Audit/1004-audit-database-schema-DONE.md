## Title
Audit Database Schema for Cost Tracking and Budget Management

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the database schema required for cost tracking and budget management functionality. This audit will assess the current state of database tables, migrations, and model relationships against the specifications defined in BUDGET_COST_TRACKING_SPECIFICATION.md.

The audit must determine:
- Whether required database tables exist (ai_cost_records, ai_user_budgets, ai_budget_alerts)
- Whether existing tables have correct schema structure and indexes
- Whether database migrations exist and are properly structured
- Whether Eloquent models exist with correct relationships and attributes
- Whether the database can support real cost tracking and budget enforcement
- What schema changes are needed to align with specification requirements

This audit is critical because the Budget Implementation Issues document indicates that required database tables don't exist, which prevents any cost tracking or budget management functionality.

Expected outcomes:
- Complete inventory of existing vs required database tables
- Assessment of table schema structure against specification
- Evaluation of database migrations and model implementations
- Analysis of database performance considerations (indexes, etc.)
- Gap analysis with specific schema remediation recommendations
- Creation of subsequent implementation tickets based on findings

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in database design and migrations. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Audit/1004-audit-database-schema.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Template Location: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/ (numbering 1010+)
- Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/ (numbering 1023+)
- Test Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/ (numbering 1033+)
- Test Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Cleanup/ (numbering 1043+)
- Each ticket must be as detailed as this audit ticket with comprehensive descriptions, related files, tests, and acceptance criteria

This is an AUDIT ticket - your goal is to assess the current state and create subsequent implementation tickets, not to implement changes.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for auditing the database schema
2. Include specific steps for comparing current schema against BUDGET_COST_TRACKING_SPECIFICATION.md
3. Plan how to assess migration files and model implementations
4. Design evaluation approach for database performance and indexing
5. Plan the gap analysis approach and documentation format
6. Plan the creation of ALL FOUR PHASES of tickets (Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup) based on audit findings
7. Each phase ticket must be as comprehensive as this audit ticket with full details
8. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with the audit

Focus on identifying what database components exist vs what needs to be created and comprehensive ticket creation for all subsequent phases.
```

## Notes
Database schema is foundational to all cost tracking functionality. This audit will determine the scope of database work needed for the Implementation phase.

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - can be done in parallel with other audits

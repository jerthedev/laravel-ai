## Title
Audit Cost Calculation and Budget Management Services

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the services layer that handles cost calculation, budget management, and cost analytics. This audit will assess the current state of services against the specifications defined in BUDGET_COST_TRACKING_SPECIFICATION.md.

The audit must determine:
- Whether required services exist (BudgetService, CostAnalyticsService, CostCalculationService)
- Whether existing services can calculate real costs from AI provider responses
- Whether token usage extraction works for all supported providers (OpenAI, XAI, Gemini)
- Whether budget enforcement logic is implemented and functional
- Whether cost analytics and reporting functionality exists
- Why the cost system always returns 0 (as identified during E2E testing)

This audit is critical because E2E testing revealed that the cost system always returns 0, indicating fundamental issues with cost calculation services.

Expected outcomes:
- Complete inventory of existing vs required services
- Assessment of cost calculation accuracy for each AI provider
- Evaluation of budget management functionality
- Analysis of cost analytics and reporting capabilities
- Root cause analysis of why costs return 0
- Gap analysis with specific remediation recommendations
- Creation of subsequent implementation tickets based on findings

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in service layer architecture and AI provider integration. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Audit/1003-audit-cost-calculation-services.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Template Location: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/ (numbering 1009+)
- Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/ (numbering 1022+)
- Test Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/ (numbering 1032+)
- Test Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Cleanup/ (numbering 1042+)
- Each ticket must be as detailed as this audit ticket with comprehensive descriptions, related files, tests, and acceptance criteria

This is an AUDIT ticket - your goal is to assess the current state and create subsequent implementation tickets, not to implement changes.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for auditing the cost calculation and budget services
2. Include specific steps for testing cost calculation with real AI provider responses
3. Plan how to assess token usage extraction for each supported provider
4. Design evaluation approach for budget management functionality
5. Plan root cause analysis for why costs return 0 in E2E testing
6. Plan the gap analysis approach and documentation format
7. Plan the creation of ALL FOUR PHASES of tickets (Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup) based on audit findings
8. Each phase ticket must be as comprehensive as this audit ticket with full details
9. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with the audit

Focus on identifying why the cost calculation system is not working and comprehensive ticket creation for all subsequent phases.
```

## Notes
This audit is crucial for understanding why E2E testing shows costs as 0. The results will determine whether services need to be built from scratch or can be repaired.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - can be done in parallel with other audits

# Audit Event System Foundation

## Title
Audit Event System Foundation for Cost Tracking

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the current event system foundation that supports cost tracking functionality. This audit will assess the current state of events, listeners, and event dispatching mechanisms against the specifications defined in BUDGET_COST_TRACKING_SPECIFICATION.md.

The audit must determine:
- Which events exist vs which are required by the specification
- Whether existing events have correct constructors and can be dispatched
- Whether event listeners are properly registered and functional
- Whether the event system can handle real cost calculation events
- What gaps exist between current implementation and specification requirements

This audit is critical because the Budget Implementation Issues document identified that events have constructor mismatches and cannot be dispatched, which breaks the entire cost tracking foundation.

Expected outcomes:
- Complete inventory of current vs required events
- Assessment of event constructor compatibility
- Evaluation of event listener registration
- Gap analysis with specific remediation recommendations
- Creation of subsequent implementation tickets based on findings

- [ ] Gap analysis document with specific issues identified
- [ ] Recommendations for Implementation phase tickets

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in event systems. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Audit/1001-audit-event-system-foundation.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Template Location: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Implementation/ (numbering 1007+)
- Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Cleanup/ (numbering 1020+)
- Test Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Implementation/ (numbering 1030+)
- Test Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Budget Cost Tracking/Test Cleanup/ (numbering 1040+)
- Each ticket must be as detailed as this audit ticket with comprehensive descriptions, related files, tests, and acceptance criteria

This is an AUDIT ticket - your goal is to assess the current state and create subsequent implementation tickets, not to implement changes.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for auditing the event system foundation
2. Include specific steps for comparing current implementation against BUDGET_COST_TRACKING_SPECIFICATION.md
3. Plan how to assess event constructor compatibility and listener registration
4. Design the gap analysis approach and documentation format
5. Plan the creation of ALL FOUR PHASES of tickets (Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup) based on audit findings
6. Each phase ticket must be as comprehensive as this audit ticket with full details
7. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with the audit

Focus on thorough assessment and comprehensive ticket creation. The audit results will drive precise, detailed tickets for all subsequent phases.
```

## Notes
This is the foundation audit ticket - all other cost tracking functionality depends on a working event system. Results from this audit will determine the scope and priority of Implementation phase tickets.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is the starting point for Budget Cost Tracking system work

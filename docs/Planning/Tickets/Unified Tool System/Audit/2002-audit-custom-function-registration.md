# Audit Custom Function Registration

**Ticket ID**: Audit/2002-audit-custom-function-registration  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26

## Title
Audit Custom Function Event Registration System

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the custom function registration system using AIFunctionEvent::listen() as specified in UNIFIED_TOOL_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md. This audit will verify whether custom functions can be registered, discovered, and executed alongside MCP tools.

The audit must determine:
- Whether AIFunctionEvent::listen() registration system exists and works
- Whether custom functions are properly integrated with the unified tool system
- Whether custom function listeners support ShouldQueue for background processing
- Whether custom functions work with both ConversationBuilder and Direct SendMessage patterns
- Whether custom functions are discoverable alongside MCP tools via withTools() and allTools()
- What implementation gaps exist in the custom function system

This audit is critical because custom function registration is a key differentiator of the unified tool system, allowing developers to register Laravel-based functions that AI can call alongside external MCP tools.

Expected outcomes:
- Verification of AIFunctionEvent::listen() registration functionality
- Assessment of custom function integration with the unified tool system
- Testing of ShouldQueue support for background processing
- Evaluation of custom function discovery and execution
- Analysis of integration with ConversationBuilder and Direct SendMessage patterns
- Gap analysis with specific remediation recommendations
- Creation of subsequent implementation tickets based on findings

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in event systems and custom function registration. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Audit/2002-audit-custom-function-registration.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Template Location: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Implementation/ (numbering 2008+)
- Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Cleanup/ (numbering 2021+)
- Test Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Test Implementation/ (numbering 2031+)
- Test Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Test Cleanup/ (numbering 2041+)
- Each ticket must be as detailed as this audit ticket with comprehensive descriptions, related files, tests, and acceptance criteria

This is an AUDIT ticket - your goal is to assess the current state and create subsequent implementation tickets, not to implement changes.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for auditing custom function registration
2. Include specific steps for testing AIFunctionEvent::listen() functionality
3. Plan how to assess custom function integration with the unified tool system
4. Design evaluation approach for ShouldQueue support and background processing
5. Plan testing of custom function discovery and execution
6. Plan the gap analysis approach and documentation format
7. Plan the creation of ALL FOUR PHASES of tickets (Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup) based on audit findings
8. Each phase ticket must be as comprehensive as this audit ticket with full details
9. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with the audit

Focus on verifying whether custom function registration works as specified and comprehensive ticket creation for all subsequent phases.
```

## Notes
Custom function registration is a unique feature that differentiates this system from pure MCP implementations. This audit will determine implementation completeness.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - can be done in parallel with MCP server management audit

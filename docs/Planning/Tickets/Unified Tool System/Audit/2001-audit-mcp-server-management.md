# Audit MCP Server Management

**Ticket ID**: Audit/2001-audit-mcp-server-management  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-26  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Title
Audit MCP Server Management System

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management system to verify it matches the specifications defined in UNIFIED_TOOL_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md. This audit will assess whether the reported "97.8% test success rate" and "production ready" status accurately reflects the actual implementation.

The audit must determine:
- Whether MCP server discovery, configuration, and lifecycle management actually work
- Whether .mcp.json and .mcp.tools.json configuration files are properly supported
- Whether MCP servers can be started, stopped, and managed programmatically
- Whether the MCPServerManager service exists and functions correctly
- Whether artisan commands (ai:mcp:setup, ai:mcp:discover) work as specified
- What gaps exist between reported status and actual functionality

This audit is critical because the UNIFIED_TOOL_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md claims the system is "production ready" but we need to verify this against real functionality with actual MCP servers.

Expected outcomes:
- Verification of MCP server management functionality vs reported status
- Assessment of configuration file support and server lifecycle management
- Evaluation of artisan commands and programmatic server management
- Testing with real MCP servers (sequential-thinking, brave-search, github-mcp)
- Gap analysis with specific remediation recommendations
- Creation of subsequent implementation tickets based on findings

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel AI package development expert specializing in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Audit/2001-audit-mcp-server-management.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Template Location: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Implementation/ (numbering 2007+)
- Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Cleanup/ (numbering 2020+)
- Test Implementation Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Test Implementation/ (numbering 2030+)
- Test Cleanup Tickets: docs/Planning/Tickets/Unified Tool System/Test Cleanup/ (numbering 2040+)
- Each ticket must be as detailed as this audit ticket with comprehensive descriptions, related files, tests, and acceptance criteria

This is an AUDIT ticket - your goal is to assess the current state and create subsequent implementation tickets, not to implement changes.

Based on this ticket:
1. Create a comprehensive task list for auditing MCP server management functionality
2. Include specific steps for testing with real MCP servers (sequential-thinking, brave-search)
3. Plan how to verify the reported "production ready" status against actual functionality
4. Design evaluation approach for configuration files and artisan commands
5. Plan testing of server lifecycle management and tool discovery
6. Plan the gap analysis approach and documentation format
7. Plan the creation of ALL FOUR PHASES of tickets (Implementation, Cleanup, Test Implementation, Test Cleanup) based on audit findings
8. Each phase ticket must be as comprehensive as this audit ticket with full details
9. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with the audit

Focus on verifying whether the MCP system actually works as reported and comprehensive ticket creation for all subsequent phases.
```

## Notes
This audit will determine whether the reported "production ready" status is accurate or if significant implementation work is still needed for MCP server management.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is the starting point for Unified Tool System work

# Cost Tracking Feature Tests

**Sprint4b Story 1**: Real-time Cost Tracking with Events

## Acceptance Criteria
- Costs are calculated automatically via ResponseGenerated events
- Real-time cost updates processed in background queues
- Cost breakdown by provider, model, and user
- Historical cost data is preserved
- Cost calculations are accurate to provider billing
- Response times are 85% faster than synchronous processing

## Test Coverage Areas
- Cost calculation engine accuracy
- CostTrackingListener background processing
- Cost breakdown analytics (provider, model, user)
- Cost accuracy validation against provider APIs
- Performance improvements (85% faster response times)
- Historical cost data preservation

## Performance Benchmarks
- Cost Calculation: <50ms background processing
- Response Time: <200ms for API responses (85% improvement from ~1200ms)

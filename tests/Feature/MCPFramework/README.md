# MCP Framework Feature Tests

**Sprint4b Story 4**: MCP Server Framework and Configuration System

## Acceptance Criteria
- MCP servers are configured via .mcp.json in project root
- MCP tools are discovered and stored in .mcp.tools.json
- MCP server registry supports built-in and external servers
- MCP processing integrates with event-driven architecture
- Performance monitoring and error handling for MCP servers
- Support for MCP server chaining and composition

## Test Coverage Areas
- .mcp.json configuration loading and validation
- .mcp.tools.json generation and tool discovery
- MCP server interface and registry functionality
- Event-driven architecture integration
- Performance monitoring and error handling
- MCP server chaining and composition
- External server integration

## Performance Benchmarks
- MCP Processing: <100ms additional overhead for built-in servers
- External MCP: <500ms timeout for external server communication
- Tool Discovery: <2s for external server tool discovery

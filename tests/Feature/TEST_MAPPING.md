### Performance (Story 7)
**Moved Tests:**
- `MCPPerformanceTest.php` (from Performance)

**Coverage Status:** ⚠️ Limited coverage
**Gaps Identified:**
- Event processing performance tests
- Middleware execution monitoring tests
- Queue performance tests
- Performance dashboard tests

## Tests Remaining in Original Locations

### Driver Tests (Feature Area)
**Location:** `tests/Feature/Drivers/`
**Status:** ✅ Already properly organized
**Coverage:** Good coverage for OpenAI driver

### Infrastructure Tests
**Locations:**
- `tests/Unit/` - Core unit tests
- `tests/Integration/` - Integration tests
- `tests/E2E/` - End-to-end tests

**Status:** ✅ Maintained in technical organization
**Note:** These support the feature tests but aren't Sprint4b-specific

## Summary
- **Total Tests Moved:** 15 tests
- **Feature Areas with Good Coverage:** MCP Framework, MCP Setup, MCP Integration
- **Feature Areas Needing More Tests:** Cost Tracking, Budget Management, Analytics, Performance
- **Overall Sprint4b Coverage:** ~60% of acceptance criteria covered by existing tests

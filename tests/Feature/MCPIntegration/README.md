# MCP Integration Feature Tests

**Sprint4b Story 6**: MCP Testing and Event Integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- MCP servers are tested within the complete event-driven request flow
- Integration tests verify MCP + middleware + events work together
- Performance tests ensure MCP processing doesn't impact response times
- Error handling tests verify graceful degradation
- Load tests validate MCP scalability
- E2E tests with real MCP servers and external APIs

## Test Coverage Areas
- MCP integration with event-driven request flow
- MCP + middleware + events integration testing
- MCP performance impact on response times
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- MCP scalability and load testing
- E2E testing with real MCP servers
- External API integration testing

## Performance Benchmarks
- MCP Processing: <100ms additional overhead for built-in servers
- External MCP: <500ms timeout for external server communication
- Response Time: <200ms for API responses (including MCP processing)
